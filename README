Google contacts and calendar akonadi resource
Adenilson Cavalcanti

== Features ==


=== what works ===

- contacts: retrieve/add/edit/delete/query-by-updates (i.e. fast-sync)
- calendar: retrieve/add/delete/query-by-updates (i.e. fast-sync)

Network proxy can be defined in KDE System Settings and the resource
will use it.

Passwords will be stored in KWallet, for while only 1 account is allowed
(I highly recommend to use it together with KWallet, because it makes
possible to query by updates automatically whenever akonadi/kde is
restarted *without* re-entering the account details).

For hosted accounts (i.e. joe.bar@whatever.com), just input the whole user id
plus server name in configuration dialog (i.e. joe.bar@whatever.com). For
normal google accounts
(i.e. joe@gmail.com), just the username is required (i.e. joe).


=== Restrictions ===

TODO: add a UI for handling this, as libgcal 0.9.7 has support.
Only the main calendar is supported.

== Dependencies ==

It requires libgcal 0.9.7 (hosted accounts, fast-sync workaround for
gcalendar, support for multiple email addresses and telephones, recurrent events).

Some linux distributions already include the newer version of libgcal.

It also requires: boost C++, xsltproc, akonadi devel libraries.


=== libgcal ===

You will need to have libxml-dev and libcurl-dev with openssl (plus
ca-certificates to do authentication with google) to compile libgcal.

In ubuntu, the packages are: libcurl4-openssl-dev, libxml2-dev, ca-certificates.

 - checkout the code:
 $git clone git://gitorious.org/libgcal/libgcal.git

 - configure and compile, you can use either autotools or cmake based
 buildsystem (but *not both*).

 For autotools:
 $autoreconf -i -f; mkdir build; cd build; ../configure; make; sudo make install

 For cmake:
 $mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make; sudo make install

- set environment variable to the path of installation (you can add this to
your ~/.bashrc file): export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

After this, you are set to compile the google contacts and calendar resources,
as long you have akonadi and KDE development packages. You will need to
restart akonadi server *after* installing the resources
(i.e. akonadictl restart).
