== Google contacts and calendar akonadi resource ==

What works:

- contacts: retrieve/add/edit/delete/query-by-updates
- calendar: retrieve/add/delete/query-by-updates

Network proxy can be defined in KDE System Settings and the resource
will use it.

Passwords will be stored in KWallet, for while only 1 account is allowed
(I highly recommend to use it together with KWallet, because it makes
possible to query by updates automatically whenever akonadi/kde is
restarted *without* re-entering the account details).

Requires at least libgcal 0.9.0, support for hosted accounts
(e.g. joe@foo.bar.com) requires libgcal 0.9.1. Some linux distributions
already include the newer version of libgcal.


== libgcal ==

You will need to have libxml-dev and libcurl-dev with openssl (plus
ca-certificates to do authentication with google) to compile libgcal.

In ubuntu, the packages are: libcurl4-openssl-dev, libxml2-dev, ca-certificates.

 - checkout the code:
 $git clone git://repo.or.cz/libgcal.git

 - configure and compile, you can use either autotools or cmake based
 buildsystem (but *not both*).

 For autotools:
 $autoreconf -i -f; mkdir build; cd build; ../configure; make; sudo make install

 For cmake:
 $mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make; sudo make install

- set environment variable to the path of installation (you can add this to
your ~/.bashrc file): export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

After this, you are set to compile the google contacts and calendar resources,
as long you have akonadi and KDE development packages. You will need to
restart akonadi server *after* installing the resources
(i.e. akonadictl restart).
