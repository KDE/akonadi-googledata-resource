2009-07-27 20:14  adasilva

	* calendar/gcalresource.cpp, contacts/googledataresource.cpp: When
	  there are no items, still got to notify akonadi server that the
	  sync is done.
	  
	  Thanks to krake for discovering why when akonadi restarted the
	  resources were
	  stuck syncing.

2009-07-10 20:27  adasilva

	* calendar/gcalresource.cpp: A better workaround for gcalendar bug:
	  it will add a new dummy
	  event and force a slow sync.
	  
	  This way the code makes sure that the next fast sync will
	  succeed.

2009-07-09 10:01  krake

	  http://code.google.com/p/gdata-issues/issues/detail?id=1036
	  
	  But I think I have detected a bug within the way that akonadi

	* contacts/googledataresource.cpp: Fix for the following scenario:
	  if user did any operation (add/edit/delete)
	  when the computer is not connected to the network, the operation
	  will be retried
	  when akonadi server was restarted.
	  
	  The problem is that the operation will happen *before* getting
	  the password
	  from KWallet and it will fail.
	  
	  I added code to call the configuration dialog and give the user
	  one last chance
	  to authenticate with google server.
	  
	  I must do the same for gcalendar.

	  The current implementation doesn't save the option in resource
	  config file
	  but in the kwallet.
	  
	  A proper implementation should offer this option as an 'advanced'
	  dialog,

	  (thanks for some missing fields like summary).
	  
	  I will debug this later.

2009-04-07 19:41  adasilva

	  more than 1 calendar, user should be capable of choosing which

2009-03-24 18:15  adasilva

	* Updating comments.

2009-03-24 16:20  adasilva

	* Adding some more debugging messages and treating the case of
	  inclusive
	  query-by-updated.
	  
	  New contacts are being correctly displayed by akonadi, but
	  deleted contacts
	  not.

2009-03-24 15:24  adasilva

	* Removing etag from item ID, because when a contact was deleted,
	  its Etag changes on google server
	  (and thus the informed remote ID to akonadi will change).
	  
	  From now on, all edits/deletes will be 'hard', in the sense that
	  the changes will be applied
	  *even* if the contact on google server has being updated.
	  
	  The alternative of not being able to correctly inform deleted
	  contacts are worst (I think).
	  

2009-03-24 03:59  adasilva

	* Ouch! Etag change when contact was deleted. I will need to find
	  another way to store contact's
	  etag (instead of appending it with the remote ID) *or* ignore
	  Etag and commit change no matter what.
	  
	  Tough call.

2009-03-24 03:44  adasilva

	* I just remember that is required to set libgcal to display
	  deleted contacts (since by protocol
	  definition they are not displayed by default).
	  
	  It will correctly detect the deleted entries and report back to
	  akonadi (problem being the etag,
	  since I'm not sure what is its behavior for deleted entries).

2009-03-23 19:20  adasilva

	* Moving call to getUpdate() to retrieveItems(), updated items are
	  being
	  reported (at least newly added items).
	  
	  TODO: test deleted items.

2009-03-23 18:03  adasilva

	* Testing for timestamp validity (handles the case where there is
	  no
	  timestamp stored in resource configuration).
	  
	  For some reason, contacts reported in ::getUpdated function are
	  not
	  being displayed.
	  
	  I made the item lists class members (instead of only on member
	  function
	  scope) but still doesn't work.

2009-03-23 16:51  adasilva

	* Informing akonadi of updated contacts (at least is not
	  crashing...).
	  
	  Going to lunch now, testing later.

2009-03-23 16:22  adasilva

	* Adding code to save last updated contact timestamp.

2009-03-23 16:09  adasilva

	* Query google server by updated contacts.
	  
	  Query by updated is inclusive, so the last updated contact which
	  timestamp was saved in last retrieval *will* be included.
	  
	  Next: build items and report to akonadi.
	  

2009-03-19 18:41  adasilva

	* Aesthetics.

2009-03-19 18:39  adasilva

	* Retrieving from resource configuration the timestamp.
	  
	  What is next: use the timestamp to query by updated and report
	  changes
	  to akonadi.

2009-03-19 18:18  adasilva

	* Saving last updated contact timestamp in configuration file (is
	  will
	  save on kde/share/config/akonadi_googledata_resource_whatever).
	  
	  This is a requirement to do query by updated contacts later (and
	  keep
	  downloaded contacts in sync with google server).

2009-03-19 15:56  adasilva

	* Adding photo data when editing a contact (not tested, my system

2009-03-19 15:48  adasilva

2009-03-19 15:46  adasilva

2009-03-19 14:32  mikearthur

	* Use new FindLibGCal module. Shouldn't be needed as it's already
	  distributed but will leave it here for a while in case people are
	  running old versions of LibGCal that don't have the module
	  installed yet.

2009-03-18 23:57  adasilva

	  The idea is to store in a configuration file the timestamp of
	  last updated
	  entry and use it to do queries to google server.

	* Adding a timestamp field in configuration file.

2009-02-16 20:12  adasilva

	* Updating todos (recent commits on libgcal fixed edit/add and
	  delete/add
	  operations).

2009-02-13 18:56  adasilva

	* fullEmail() includes the username (e.g. "John Doe
	  <doe@nevermind.com>").
	  
	  I will try with prefereredEmail() and see what happens.

2009-02-13 15:33  adasilva

	* Updating todos.

2009-02-13 15:29  adasilva

	* Getting the windowId, should work better when showing dialogs (I
	  think that
	  right now is a bit confusing, since both the user account dialog
	  and
	  kwallet unlock dialog are show at the same time).

2009-02-13 15:12  adasilva

	* The idea is to get user account from kwallet when required (so
	  the user
	  will only to input the password once).

2009-02-13 14:49  adasilva

	* A pack of changes... here it goes:
	  - add some extra error checking in retrieveFromWallet
	  - moved google authentication libgcal call to a distinct class
	  member function
	  
	  The idea is next to use retrieveFromWallet to recover the user
	  account info
	  from kwallet.

2009-02-13 14:23  adasilva

	* Adding code to retrieve the user account map from KWallet (still
	  untested,
	  I'm still think where could be the better place to call this
	  function).

2009-02-13 14:16  adasilva

	* Writing a map in KWallet with a known entry name
	  ("googleAccount").
	  
	  Special thanks to lemma for providing the code snippet for this.
	  
	  Next: retrieve the user data from kwallet.

2009-02-13 13:35  adasilva

	* Use changeCommitted instead of itemRetrieved (should work now).
	  
	  Thanks igorto by the tip.

2009-02-12 22:31  adasilva

	* Updating todos.

2009-02-12 21:02  adasilva

	* Using const references to avoid unnecessary objects copies.

2009-02-12 19:52  adasilva

	* Adding code to retrieve the password from KWallet, currently not
	  used.

2009-02-12 19:40  adasilva

	* Updating todos, as libgcal is using 'const char *' for its
	  setters.

2009-02-12 19:37  adasilva

	* Starting to implement KWallet support for user account details.
	  
	  Both KWalletManager and akonadi's imap resource were useful to
	  discover
	  how KWallet API works.
	  
	  Right now the user account and its password is stored in kwallet.
	  
	  Next: retrieve the user account details from kwallet.

	* Updating todos.

2009-02-09 20:32  adasilva

	* Returning to akonadi a contact with the updated field (edit_url +
	  Etag).
	  
	  This should make possible do all operations within akonadi
	  client:
	  add/edit/delete.
	  
	  TODO: testing.

2009-02-09 20:18  adasilva

	* Using a better convertion from QByteArray to char *.

2009-02-09 18:21  adasilva

	* Adding copyright notes and a long list of todos.

2009-02-09 18:02  adasilva

	* Better error handling.

2009-02-09 17:51  adasilva

	* Using QByteArray instead of qPrintable.

2009-02-09 17:48  adasilva

	* Retriving the etag/edit_url from KUrl in itemChanged function.

2009-02-09 16:03  adasilva

	* Better error messages.

2009-02-09 15:38  adasilva

	* Making sure that gcal_contact_array is correctly initialized.

2009-02-09 14:56  adasilva

	* Retriving the etag/edit_url from KUrl in itemRemoved function.

2009-02-09 14:40  adasilva

	* Using KUrl to store ETag + edit_url. Special thanks to krake by
	  its
	  suggestion.

2009-02-09 13:56  adasilva

	* Using remoteId to store etag+edit_url.

2009-02-09 13:51  adasilva

	* Deleted items will not have the payload available, I will need to
	  change
	  the code in resource to deal with that.

2009-02-09 12:41  adasilva

	* Commenting a little bit.

2009-02-09 12:38  adasilva

	* Adding email + contact name in gcontact object when deleting (not
	  really
	  required, but help when debugging).
	  
	  I tried to swap toLocal8Bit() for toAscii() to no avail.

2009-02-09 12:03  adasilva

	* Using QByteArray to access the ETag field from contact, plus
	  accessing directly
	  contact's fields when printing debugging information.
	  
	  The good: resource will not crash anymore when deleting
	  
	  The bad: delete still fails, somehow I'm not retrieving the whole
	  URL from
	  akonadi classes.

	* Trying to fix 'delete', I discovered that the ID/Etag of a newly
	  created
	  entry was not being reported back to akonadi.
	  
	  Those fields are essential to later to operations on an entry.
	  
	  Right now it is not still working.

2009-02-04 15:50  adasilva

	* Adding better error handling and using QByteArray instead of
	  qPrintable.

2009-02-04 15:07  adasilva

	* Enabling retrieve of full payload. Now 'add' is working fine.

2009-02-04 13:13  adasilva

	* Using QByteArray to get contacts details (seems to be the
	  prefered way to
	  convert QStrings to char *).

2009-02-04 12:58  adasilva

	* Adding debug information, 'add' fails currently.

2009-02-04 12:45  adasilva

	* Aesthetics.

	* Importing google data akonadi resource. For whole development
	  history,
	  please refer to http://repo.or.cz/w/akonadigoogledata.git
	  
	  Right now it is capable of retrieving your contacts and reporting
	  them to
	  akonadi. Add/edit/delete needs testing.
	  
	  This plugin requires latest libgcal:
	  http://repo.or.cz/w/libgcal.git
