	* calendar/gcalresource.cpp, contacts/googledataresource.cpp,

	  shared/googledata.cpp: Updating remaining source code files to
	  match LGPL license.
	  
	  I was going to license it using GPLv2, but later I discovered
	  that
	  akonadi itself uses LGPL, so the change in licensing.
	  
	  I hope with this commit to solve any licensing issue stopping
	  packagers to do their job.
	  
	  ps: thanks dyndns and DD-WRT for making this commit possible.

	* contacts/googledataresource.cpp: Fix for the following scenario:
	  if user did any operation (add/edit/delete)
	  when the computer is not connected to the network, the operation
	  will be retried
	  when akonadi server was restarted.
	  
	  The problem is that the operation will happen *before* getting
	  the password
	  from KWallet and it will fail.
	  
	  I added code to call the configuration dialog and give the user
	  one last chance
	  to authenticate with google server.
	  
	  I must do the same for gcalendar.
	* contacts/googledataresource.cpp: Base class member function
	  already sets authenticated to proper
	  state.

	* Updating documentation (yes, we should do that...).
	  :-)
	* Updating todos.
	* Implemented query-by-updated in gcalendar resource. Now the
	  resource will 'sync'
	  with google server and retrieve *only* the changes like newly
	  added (or edited)
	  events (as also deleted events).
	  
	  Now the following operations are supported:
	  add/edit/delete/query-by-updates.
	* Filling Item::List with updated and deleted events.
	  
	  What is next: call this function when the resource is started.
	* Starting to implement query by updated events (this is a

	  Now edit is working.
	* Adding code to edit an event (needs testing).

	* Removing left over comment.
	* Using clone instead of new (less verbose).
	* Using the same technique with auto_ptr to retrieve event payload
	  for adding event.
	  
	  The good news: add succeeds. The bad: it will set start/end time
	  for the event
	  (thanks for some missing fields like summary).
	  
	  I will debug this later.
	* Adding one more todo.

	  support
	  more than 1 calendar, user should be capable of choosing which
	  one to

	  since each will need to store its own timestamp.
	* Adding skeleton for gcalendar resource.
	  
	  I'm planning to have both resources on this directory.
	* Updating todo.
	* Moving common code to a base class.
	* Renaming the class name (I'm going to write another resource for

2009-03-30  adasilva

	* Better error handling in case of wrong password or failure to
	  authenticate.

2009-03-24  adasilva

	* Updating comments.
	* Adding some more debugging messages and treating the case of
	  inclusive
	  query-by-updated.
	  
	  New contacts are being correctly displayed by akonadi, but
	  deleted contacts
	  not.
	* Removing etag from item ID, because when a contact was deleted,
	  its Etag changes on google server
	  (and thus the informed remote ID to akonadi will change).
	  
	  From now on, all edits/deletes will be 'hard', in the sense that
	  the changes will be applied
	  *even* if the contact on google server has being updated.
	  
	  The alternative of not being able to correctly inform deleted
	  contacts are worst (I think).
	  
	* Ouch! Etag change when contact was deleted. I will need to find
	  another way to store contact's
	  etag (instead of appending it with the remote ID) *or* ignore
	  Etag and commit change no matter what.
	  
	  Tough call.
	* I just remember that is required to set libgcal to display
	  deleted contacts (since by protocol
	  definition they are not displayed by default).
	  
	  It will correctly detect the deleted entries and report back to
	  akonadi (problem being the etag,
	  since I'm not sure what is its behavior for deleted entries).

2009-03-23  adasilva

	* Moving call to getUpdate() to retrieveItems(), updated items are
	  being
	  reported (at least newly added items).
	  
	  TODO: test deleted items.
	* Testing for timestamp validity (handles the case where there is
	  no
	  timestamp stored in resource configuration).
	  
	  For some reason, contacts reported in ::getUpdated function are
	  not
	  being displayed.
	  
	  I made the item lists class members (instead of only on member
	  function
	  scope) but still doesn't work.
	* Informing akonadi of updated contacts (at least is not
	  crashing...).
	  
	  Going to lunch now, testing later.
	* Adding code to save last updated contact timestamp.
	* Query google server by updated contacts.
	  
	  Query by updated is inclusive, so the last updated contact which
	  timestamp was saved in last retrieval *will* be included.
	  
	  Next: build items and report to akonadi.
	  

2009-03-19  adasilva

	* Aesthetics.
	* Retrieving from resource configuration the timestamp.
	  
	  What is next: use the timestamp to query by updated and report
	  changes
	  to akonadi.
	* Saving last updated contact timestamp in configuration file (is
	  will
	  save on kde/share/config/akonadi_googledata_resource_whatever).
	  
	  This is a requirement to do query by updated contacts later (and
	  keep
	  downloaded contacts in sync with google server).
	* Adding photo data when editing a contact (not tested, my system
	  is
	  borked).
	* Updating todos comments.
	* Cleaning up the code and adding some debugging msg (not a good
	  commit to
	  be honest).
	* Updating todo (photo is being displayed in webbrowser).

	  The idea is to store in a configuration file the timestamp of
	  last updated
	  entry and use it to do queries to google server.

2009-02-13  adasilva

	* fullEmail() includes the username (e.g. "John Doe
	  <doe@nevermind.com>").
	  
	  I will try with prefereredEmail() and see what happens.
	* Updating todos.
	* Getting the windowId, should work better when showing dialogs (I
	  think that
	  right now is a bit confusing, since both the user account dialog
	  and
	  kwallet unlock dialog are show at the same time).
	* The idea is to get user account from kwallet when required (so
	  the user
	  will only to input the password once).
	* A pack of changes... here it goes:
	  - add some extra error checking in retrieveFromWallet
	  - moved google authentication libgcal call to a distinct class
	  member function
	  
	  The idea is next to use retrieveFromWallet to recover the user
	  account info
	  from kwallet.
	* Adding code to retrieve the user account map from KWallet (still
	  untested,
	  I'm still think where could be the better place to call this
	  function).
	* Writing a map in KWallet with a known entry name
	  ("googleAccount").
	  
	  Special thanks to lemma for providing the code snippet for this.
	  
	  Next: retrieve the user data from kwallet.
	* Use changeCommitted instead of itemRetrieved (should work now).
	  
	  Thanks igorto by the tip.

	  setters.
	* Starting to implement KWallet support for user account details.
	  
	  Both KWalletManager and akonadi's imap resource were useful to
	  discover
	  how KWallet API works.
	  
	  Right now the user account and its password is stored in kwallet.

	* Better error messages.
	* Making sure that gcal_contact_array is correctly initialized.
	* Retriving the etag/edit_url from KUrl in itemRemoved function.
	* Using KUrl to store ETag + edit_url. Special thanks to krake by
	  its
	  suggestion.
	* Using remoteId to store etag+edit_url.
	* Deleted items will not have the payload available, I will need to
	  change
	  the code in resource to deal with that.
	* Commenting a little bit.
	* Adding email + contact name in gcontact object when deleting (not
	  really
	  required, but help when debugging).
	  
	  I tried to swap toLocal8Bit() for toAscii() to no avail.
	* Using QByteArray to access the ETag field from contact, plus
	  accessing directly
	  contact's fields when printing debugging information.
	  
	  The good: resource will not crash anymore when deleting
	  
	  The bad: delete still fails, somehow I'm not retrieving the whole
	  URL from

	* Trying to fix 'delete', I discovered that the ID/Etag of a newly
	  created
	  entry was not being reported back to akonadi.
	  
	  Those fields are essential to later to operations on an entry.
	  
	  Right now it is not still working.
	* Adding better error handling and using QByteArray instead of
	  qPrintable.
	* Enabling retrieve of full payload. Now 'add' is working fine.
	* Using QByteArray to get contacts details (seems to be the
	  prefered way to
	  convert QStrings to char *).
	* Adding debug information, 'add' fails currently.
	* Aesthetics.
	* Returning the item (patch by krake).
